* Move 'Preferences' to File menu on non-Mac systems... maybe.

* Better icons (the add-ons one is nice but seems to do something to
  the tab header bar background)

* Something's funny going on with the Preference window size,
  depending on whether one of the new prefpanes are selected upon
  opening of the dialog or not.

* Would be nice to remove the 'Account settings' menu item in the
  message composer window as well, but it seems they forgot in
  comm-central/mail/components/compose/content/messengercompose.xul to
  give this menu item an ID :(

* Get rid of the 'Save' button in the Accounts preference tab.

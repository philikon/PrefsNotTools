This is a Thunderbird extension that fixes one of the many glitches in
the Thunderbird UI: account and add-on settings aren't part of the
general preferences dialog but instead have their own dialogs.  Even
worse, these dialogs can't be reached with a keyboard shortcut.

This extension moves the contents of these dialogs into preference
panes in the general preferences dialog
